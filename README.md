DevCongress Jobs
================

The Official Job Board for Developers in Ghana. Looking to hire a developer in Ghana? Then look no further!

## Overview
This project aims to provide organisations with access to a unified pool of quality Ghanaian developers, who they can engage to fill up job openings either on a full or part-time basis. 

Developers on the other hand will be able to find jobs and more importantly, market their skills to prospective employers, co-founders and more :)

## Project Structure
As you're probably aware, the project will be written in NodeJS. Here's what the stack looks like:
 
### Backend
- [NodeJS](nodejs.org) - Server
- [Express JS](expressjs.com) - Routing, Sessions, Request / Request handling etc.
- [Mongo DB](mongodb.org) - Database

### Frontend
- [Jade](jade-lang.com) - HTML Views (Creation & Rendering)
- [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) - Stylesheet (CSS Precompling)
- [jQuery](jquery.com) - Client Side Processing (validation, AJAX etc)

## Proposed Feature Set
Here are a few features that might be interesting to have in the final release. This list isn't meant to be exhaustive, so feel free to share your thoughts. Excited to hear what you think on this :)
 
### Employers:
- Post a new Job Listing
- Update an existing job listing
- View the details for a listing
- View a history of all listings they've posted
- Browse a developer database by keyword (eg. PHP, Rails etc)  

### Developers:
- Browse job listings by category / keyword (eg. freelance, full-time, Rails, Javascript etc)
- View the details of a listing
- View the summary/bio of an the employer
- View other/all postings by a given employer
- Apply for an opening - This could include steps like writing a brief cover letter, uploading a resume & sending it off the employer. Just saying :)
